# RV32I
The goal for this project is ultimately to make a simulator for simple RV32I assembly programs.

# Tools
* flex
* bison
* C++

# assem
rename later

Assem handles input and output. For now I have just made a lex and yacc file to break down a program into directives, labels, and instructions.

Will include:
* classification system for instructions
* improved register system
* organization of code into control flow

# CPU
To be planned
* Pipelined

# Memory
To be planned
* L1 Data Cache
* L1 Instruction Cache
* L2 Data Cache
* Main Memory
